# 👋 Hi, I'm Shruti Wakchoure

🎓 MS in Data Science from the Univeristy of Colorado Boulder

I'm passionate about transforming complex data into meaningful insights. Whether it's building predictive models, crafting compelling visualizations, or uncovering hidden patterns, I thrive on turning data into impactful stories. When I'm not immersed in data, you might find me experimenting in the kitchen or volunteering for causes close to my heart.

💼 Currently open to data science, analytics, or visualization roles where I can grow, contribute, and make meaningful impact. Let's connect!
